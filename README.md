# template-client

Client (React) Template for CT42

## Getting Started

Install "ESLint" and "Prettier - Code formatter" extensions for VSCode by clicking on the extensions tab and searching ESLint and Prettier.

Once these extensions are installed, navigate to the "client" directory and

    $ npm i

to install packages.

Make sure the "format on save" setting is turned on in VSCode, so that formatting changes can occur automatically upon saving.

To run the app,

    $ npm start

and it should open a new tab in your default browser with the app running. If it does not, try opening a tab in your browser and typing "localhost:3000" into the address bar.
